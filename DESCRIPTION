Description: Adds functionality for hexbin layers to 'leaflet' maps. There is a javascript 
    library for this hexbin function already so this package creates an R interface for using
    that library to make it much easier to access. This package is intended to be a plugin for
    'leaflet' and the API attempts to mirror 'leaflet' style.
